## Advanced Usage
### Custom Decoy Sounds
You can make a Decoy Grenade play a specific sound using NBT tags when giving the item. This is useful for map-making and custom scenarios.

Use the `/give` command and add a `DecoySound` tag with the resource location of the desired sound.

**Example:**
To give yourself a decoy grenade that plays a creeper priming sound:
```
/give @p csgrenades:decoy{DecoySound:"minecraft:entity.creeper.primed"} 1
```
If the `DecoySound` tag is not provided, the decoy will play mob sounds by default.

## Tacz Mod Integration (Optional)
This mod provides an optional integration with the [Tacz gun mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/timeless-and-classics-zero) for enhanced decoy grenade functionality.

### Dynamic Gun Sounds
If the Tacz mod is installed, decoy grenades will prioritize playing realistic gun sounds from the Tacz mod instead of default mob sounds.

**How it works:**
1.  When a decoy grenade lands and activates, it scans the throwing player's inventory *once*.
2.  It identifies the first Tacz gun (e.g., AK-47, M4A1) in the inventory.
3.  For its entire duration, the decoy grenade will repeatedly play the "shoot" sound of that specific Tacz gun.

**Priority:**
The Tacz integration takes the highest priority for decoy sounds. If Tacz is installed, it will override any custom sounds set via NBT tags. If Tacz is not installed, the decoy will fall back to custom NBT sounds, or default vanilla sounds.

### Decoy Explosion
The final explosion of the decoy grenade has been adjusted to a very low-strength (0.1f) vanilla explosion. This removes the unrealistic knockback effect while still providing a visual and sound cue for the decoy's end-of-life.

## API for Developers
This mod provides an API for other developers to integrate with.

### Checking if a Player is Flashed
You can check if a player is currently under the effect of a flashbang using the `CSGrenadesAPI`.

**Usage (Java):**
```java
import club.pisquad.minecraft.csgrenades.api.CSGrenadesAPI;
import net.minecraft.world.entity.player.Player;

// Assuming you have a player object, e.g., 'targetPlayer'
boolean isFlashed = CSGrenadesAPI.isPlayerFlashed(targetPlayer);

if (isFlashed) {
    // Player is currently flashed
} else {
    // Player is not flashed
}
```

### Canceling a Grenade Throw
You can listen for the `GrenadeThrowEvent` and cancel it to prevent a grenade from being thrown. This event is fired on the Forge event bus.

**Usage (Java):**
```java
import club.pisquad.minecraft.csgrenades.event.GrenadeThrowEvent;
import net.minecraftforge.eventbus.api.SubscribeEvent;

public class MyEventHandler {
    @SubscribeEvent
    public void onGrenadeThrow(GrenadeThrowEvent event) {
        // Example: Prevent players from throwing grenades while sneaking
        if (event.getPlayer().isShiftKeyDown()) {
            event.setCanceled(true); // This will stop the grenade from being thrown
        }
    }
}

// Remember to register your event handler class on the Forge event bus:
// MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(new MyEventHandler());
```

## Config
In version `1.2.*` or later, you can customize this mod's behavior via [Forge's server side config](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.20.1/misc/config/#registering-a-configuration).

Config file for this mod is named `csgrenade-server.toml` under `saves/<save name>/serverconfig` folder

Below is the default one
```toml

## Commands
This mod provides server-side commands to configure grenade behavior in-game. You must have operator permissions (level 2) to use them.

### Set Self-Damage Policy
You can control whether HE grenades and fire grenades (Incendiary/Molotov) can damage their owner.

**Usage:**
`/csgrenades <grenadeType> causeDamageToOwner <value>`

-   `<grenadeType>`: The type of grenade to configure.
    -   `hegrenade`
    -   `firegrenade`
-   `<value>`: The self-damage policy.
    -   `always`: Grenades will always damage their owner. (Default)
    -   `not_in_team`: Grenades will only damage their owner if team-based friendly fire is enabled.
    -   `never`: Grenades will never damage their owner.

**Example:**
`/csgrenades hegrenade causeDamageToOwner never`

### Set Global Settings
You can configure global settings that affect all grenades.

**Usage:**
`/csgrenades global <setting> <value>`

-   `<setting>`: The global setting to change.
    -   `ignoreBarrierBlock`: Controls if grenades pass through barrier blocks.
-   `<value>`: The value for the setting.
    -   `true`: Grenades will fly through barrier blocks.
    -   `false`: Grenades will collide with barrier blocks. (Default)

**Example:**
`/csgrenades global ignoreBarrierBlock true`
